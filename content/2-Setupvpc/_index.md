In this section, we will create a custom VPC and setup route tables, security groups as well as create EC2 Instance Connect endpoint to connect to EC2 Instances. After that, we will deploy an Online Shop web application with the ability of automatically scaling across 2 Availability Zones in the event of high request accesses.
